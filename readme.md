# Scripts from "Host genetic factors related to innate immunity, environmental sensing and cellular functions influence human skin microbiota"

This folder contains scripts used in the manuscript **Host genetic factors related to innate immunity, environmental sensing and cellular functions influence human skin microbiota**. It is build on individual data processing of PopGen and KORA FF4 cohorts, which are then combined and analyzed together. Processing of individual cohort data was performed as in previous [publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjd.20072), which can be found in its dedicated [githubpage](https://github.com/LucasMS/skin.association). 

## Reproduction

Folders are enumerated in the order analyses were performed. Similarly, scripts are enumerated according to the order that they were executed.  Some of them contain nested folders and scripts with the same logic. Manuscript tables and figures are originated from folders **tables** and **functions**, which use as input results produced from the enumerated folders. Folder **functions** contains auxiliary functions called by other scripts.

Details on package and software versions are found in the manuscript methods section.
